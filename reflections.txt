# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
My third gem is 'terminal-table'.
I use it to create a more structured table for todo list.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Feature 1...
  First feature is 'due_soon', it's like method 'filter'. Instead of select the correct type, it
  select tasks that due in one day.
  b) Feature 2...
  Second one is 'complete', after user completing one task, it will remove this task from the todo
  list. I think this is more useful than delete(index) method because users don's want to remember
  the index to delete task.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
I spend about 10 hours.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Changing other's code is harder than I thought. Things I learn from this is: if you want to work on
other's code, don't start to read his/her code immediately, it's hard to get the logic behind other's
project. What you can do is start from the Terminal input, try to understand every features, then move
to code.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
I want to add some features that can give users more information. This is why my first feature 'due soon'
comes in. It can let users focus on most urgent tasks.
The reason I add 'complete' feature is that I think this is a required feature in all todo apps. Without
it, the todo list will be there forever.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
There are some Hash arguments in the code that troubles me a lot. I think I need more practice on Hash
in general.
